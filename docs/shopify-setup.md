title: How the Adapter works
---

With the Udesly Adapter you can connect Webflow to the Shopify e-commerce platform. How? Design your e-commerce in Webflow (you can either start from scratch or choose one of the Webflow templates) and then convert it to a real Shopify theme in a few steps that we'll see together in this guide.

`The *ratio* behind the Adapter is that every change concerning the layout must be done in Webflow, in such a way as to exploit its limitless design freedom, while the content can be edited from the Shopify admin panel directly, without need to go back and forth from the Webflow project.`

In order to have a Webflow template ready to be converted to a Shopify one, you have to add custom attributes to specific pages and elements within your Webflow project. 

If you’re designing your template from scratch, remember to add the the required custom attributes while designing your pages in Webflow. This way you’ll fasten the workflow because everything will be ready to be converted to Shopify after you export the HTML project from Webflow.
