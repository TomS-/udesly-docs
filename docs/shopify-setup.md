title: How the Adapter works
---

With the Udesly Adapter you can connect Webflow to Shopify e-commerce platform. How? Design the Shopify e-commerce starting from a Webflow template and convert it to a real Shopify theme in a few steps that we'll see together in this guide.

The *ratio* behind the Adapter is that every change concerning the **layout** must be done in Webflow, in such a way as to exploit its limitlessdesign freedom, while the **content** can be edited from Shopify admin panel directly, without need to access the template everytime.

In order to make a Webflow template ready to be converted to a Shopify one, you have to enter a series of custom attributes to specific elements within your Webflow project.
