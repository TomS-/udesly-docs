## Import data from Webflow
This is the most important section. After the converted template upload and activation, you have to synchronize the template content. From the "Import from Webflow" section you can find the "Import pages and frontend editor data" button to synchronize the Webflow template content with WordPress. You can also delete all the imported pages or frontend editor elements. From the side menu you can check your missed elements and custom fields.
