Elements are the building blocks, components and content that make up your site pages. In order to have your Webflow project fully converted and working in Shopify, you need to add custom attributes to some page elements. 
The different sections of this documentation walk through all the elements available in Webflow, showing how to configure them in the quickest way to get them ready to be converted with the Adapter after you export the HTML project from Webflow.

If youâ€™re starting from scratch, we suggest using our pre-configured [elements pack](https://preview.webflow.com/preview/webflow-to-shopify-elements?utm_medium=preview_link&utm_source=designer&utm_content=webflow-to-shopify-elements&preview=71280fc62c37d44b2222bbe7b9a3e953&mode=preview) while designing your pages in Webflow. This will help you quicken the workflow because the required attributes are already added to the element you want to design in your page and ready to be converted to Shopify.  
If you start from a pre-made template, the quicker workflow is to add the custom attributes manually following our doc.
