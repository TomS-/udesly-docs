With Boxes you can add dynamic contents into your Webflow project and revise them directly from the WordPress admin panel. Any time you create a box, youâ€™ll find a correlate shortcode.

## Dynamic Slider
You can now use the Webflow Slider and manage images directly from WordPress, through the Boxes feature.

Insert a Slider item into your Webflow project and add these attributes:

> boxes:slider={slug of the box}

**Don't forget to add a Gallery inside the box**
