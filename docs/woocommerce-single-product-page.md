In WordPress that are several type of pages that can display a single post of your Blog.  Don't forget to define your page accordingly to the list below by adding the correspondent attribute on the body of the page:

<pre>
<video autoplay muted playsinline="true" loop>
<source src="/assets/page-type.webm">
</video>
</pre>

- **Single Product Page**

    This page is used for each Product of your Shop. This page must have the following attribute on the Body:

    > page=single
    >
    > post-type=product    


- **Specific Product**

    This page is used for a *specific* produc of your WooCommerce to give it a different style from the others . This page must have the following attribute on the Body:

    > page=single
    >
    >post-type=product
    >
    > specific={slug of your post or ID of your product}

**Webflow allows to include Add to Cart element only in the default product template. For this reason you can include Add to Cart element in a specific Single Product page. This kind of page may be useful for external or coming soon products.**

- **Single Product Template**

    This page is a template that can be used instead of your generic single product page. To be displayed, you have to select the template from WordPress backend (for each product). This page must have the following attribute on the Body:

    > page=template
    >
    > post-type=product

**Webflow allows to include Add to Cart element only in the default product template. For this reason you can include Add to Cart element in a specific Single Product page. This kind of page may be useful for external or coming soon products.**

*The following list includes all elements you can enter within these pages.*

> **Tips:**
> Take a look at our [elements pack](https://preview.webflow.com/preview/webflow-to-shopify-elements?utm_medium=preview_link&utm_source=designer&utm_content=webflow-to-shopify-elements&preview=71280fc62c37d44b2222bbe7b9a3e953&mode=preview). Itâ€™s a set of all the most used elements with the necessary custom attributes already added. You just need to copy and paste the element in your Webflow page and give it your own style. This will help you quicken the workflow. If you have already completed your design and just want to convert the project to Shopify, maybe the quicker way to proceed is to add the custom attributes manually following our guide.
