## How to configure Shortcodes

A shortcode is a WordPress-specific code that lets you do nifty things with very little effort. Shortcodes can embed files or create objects that would normally require lots of complicated, ugly code in just one line. It make you able to use the most of WordPress plugins.

Insert a **Text Block** and just insert these attributes

> wp=general
>
> el=shortcode

Shortcode must be inserted within the Text Block.

**E.g.** we want to create a Contact Form using the Contact Form 7 plugin.

What we have to do is to insert the shortcode released by the plugin itself in a Text Block and add the attributes above.
