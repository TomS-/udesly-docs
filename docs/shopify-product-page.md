This template renders a detailed page for an individual product. 

![](assets/shopify-product-page.jpg)

These items can be used only in the page set as **Product page**.
Product page must have the following attribute entered on the body:

> page=product

<pre>
<video autoplay muted playsinline="true" loop>
<source src="/assets/page-type.webm">
</video>
</pre>

> **Tips:**
> Take a look at our [elements pack](https://preview.webflow.com/preview/webflow-to-shopify-elements?utm_medium=preview_link&utm_source=designer&utm_content=webflow-to-shopify-elements&preview=71280fc62c37d44b2222bbe7b9a3e953&mode=preview). Itâ€™s a set of all the most used elements with the necessary custom attributes already added. You just need to copy and paste the element in your Webflow page and give it your own style. This will help you quicken the workflow. If you have already completed your design and just want to convert the project to Shopify, maybe the quicker way to proceed is to add the custom attributes manually following our guide.
>
> Otherwise, you can start from scratch, following the guide below.


## Title
It's the title of the product and can be added to any text element, will also add the link if set on a link text.
Insert the attribute:

## Featured Image
It's the featured image of the product. It can be added to an image or to any other element as background image, will also add the link if set on a link block.

To handle featured image settings, there are several optional attributes you can use.
