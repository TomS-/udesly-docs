## Search Query

Search Query is the element that shows the keywords user inserted inside the Search Form. It can be inserted only in the page you set as **Search Page** in the Udesly Adapter.
Insert a **Text Block**, a **Header** or **Paragraph** and just insert these attributes:

> wp=search
>
> el=search-query
