The first step in building a theme for Shopify is to create several pages, each serving their own unique purpose. All of them are required to have a well-functioning Shopify theme.
They are totally customizable and you can add more but the following are essential.
They are:

> 404
>
> article
>
> blog
>
> cart
>
> collection
> 
> customers/account
>
> customers/activate_account
>
> customer/addresses
>
> customers/login
>
> customers/order
>
> customers/register
>
> customers/reset_password
>
> gift_card
>
> index
>
> list-collections
>
> page
>
> password
>
> product
>
> search

 
All the additional pages you have created in Webflow shall be configured as **Template Page** into the Adapter and recreated in Shopify.
