## Insert your template data
Insert your template name, the author name and a template description. If you want, you can also choose the featured image of your theme (that you can find in your WordPress admin panel after the conversion).

## Set the pages of your template
This is the most important step. Here you need to set up all the WooCommerce pages of your Webflow template to make them ready to use in WordPress.
Here is the list of the page types you can assign to each page of your Webflow project:

#### WooCommerce Pages:
– Shop (this is the Shop page in which you can manage all the products included in your storage);
– Single Product (this page illustrates the card of the single product and all its specifications);
– Category (Used to style a specific category archive page of your shop, the page must be named as the slug of the category);
– Tag (Used to style a specific tag archive page of your shop, the page must be named as the slug of the tag);
– Single Product Template (pre-styled page that can be choosen to style a product of your shop differently);
– Search Results (page used to show the search results of a specific query within WooCommerce, it must contain the element “Search Results”).

If your site includes the blog as well, you must set the appropriate pages. Take a look here.

## Optional Settings
In this step you can choose if you want to manage your website SEO from Webflow or from the WordPress admin panel directly. We suggest to not uncheck the “Remove Webflow jQuery”to make it work correctly.

## Install the Udesly Customizer plugin
Use this free WordPress plugin to customize the WooCommerce default pages (Cart, Checkout and My Account) and elements style. Thanks to the Udesly customizer you can control many elements you can’t change in your Webflow design, directly from the frontend of your site. You can find the Customizer documentation following this [link](https://docs.udesly.com/webflow-resources/udesly-customizer-plugin/).
