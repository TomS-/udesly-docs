This guide shows how to add the attributes in Webflow to configure the blog and have it ready to convert to Shopify through the Udesly Adapter.

 Some of these items can be used only in the page set as **Blog page** (Blog page must have the following attribute entered on the body):

> page=blog

<pre>
<video autoplay muted playsinline="true" loop>
<source src="/assets/page-type.webm">
</video>
</pre>

> **Tips:**
> Take a look at our [elements pack](https://webflow.com/website/webflow-to-shopify-elements). Itâ€™s a set of all the most used elements with the necessary custom attributes already added. You just need to copy and paste the element in your Webflow page and give it your own style. This will help you quicken the workflow. If you have already completed your design and just want to convert the project to Shopify, maybe the quicker way to proceed is to add the custom attributes manually following our guide.

> Otherwise, you can start from scratch, following the guide below.
