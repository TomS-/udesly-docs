## How it works
Install and activate the WooCommerce to Webflow exporter plugin into your WordPress admin panel.
Go to "tools" and click on "WooCommerce to Webflow".
Choose a specific category or all the products and click on the "Export" button.

Once you have the converted CSV file you are ready to import the products in Webflow.

Go to Webflow, open the e-commerce menu from your designer and click on the products menu. On the top right you can find the "Import" button. Drag the CSV you have exported from the plugin, and the work is done!
