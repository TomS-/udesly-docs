These elements can be added on all pages of your Website.

> **Tips:**
> Take a look at our [elements pack](https://preview.webflow.com/preview/webflow-to-shopify-elements?utm_medium=preview_link&utm_source=designer&utm_content=webflow-to-shopify-elements&preview=71280fc62c37d44b2222bbe7b9a3e953&mode=preview). Itâ€™s a set of all the most used elements with the necessary custom attributes already added. You just need to copy and paste the element in your Webflow page and give it your own style. This will help you quicken the workflow. If you have already completed your design and just want to convert the project to Shopify, maybe the quicker way to proceed is to add the custom attributes manually following our guide.

## Shop Notifications

It can be entered only once in the project, if not set it will fallback to unstyled notifications.

There can be two notification types:

    > item=message

- ### Notification Error

  On a Div add the attribute:

its adviced to set transition for opacity on the div for animation and set it as **Position fixed**
