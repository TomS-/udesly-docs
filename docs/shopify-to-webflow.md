title: Shopify to Webflow CSV Converter

## How it works
Go to the "products" menu from your Shopify panel and click on the "export" button.

Install and launch the Udesly App (MacOS and Windows), import the Shopify CSV to start the conversion.

Once you have the converted CSV file you are ready to import the products in Webflow.

Go to Webflow, open the e-commerce menu from your designer and click on the products menu. On the top right you can find the "Import" button. Drag the CSV you have exported from the plugin, and the work is done!
