## How to configure Search Results

Search Results is an element that can be inserted only in the page you set as **Search Page** in the Udesly Adapter.

If youâ€™ve already created a Blog Posts CMS collection in Webflow, skip the following steps.

1) Click on CMS
2) Click on Add New
3) Select Blog Posts collection
4) Customize the collection adding all the WordPress usual fields to have the perfect preview
5) Click on Create
6) Insert some dummy data.

Insert a **Collection List** element and connect it to the Blog Posts Collection.

Select Collection List Wrapper in the navigator and insert these attributes for Categories.

> wp=search
>
> el=search-results

Select now the Collection Item from the navigation and customize your posts. You can add all elements or only the one you desire:

#### Title
This will be the title of your search result. To create it select a **Text Block** and insert the attribute:

> el-child=title

connect it to the field **name** of the CMS
