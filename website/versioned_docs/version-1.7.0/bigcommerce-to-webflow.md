## How it works
Go to products >> export. Click on the "export" button and export your products as CSV.

Install and launch the Udesly App (MacOS and Windows), import the BigCommerce CSV to start the conversion.

Once you have the converted CSV file you are ready to import the products in Webflow.

Go to Webflow, open the e-commerce menu from your designer and click on the products menu. On the top right you can find the "Import" button. Drag the CSV you have exported from the plugin, and the work is done!
