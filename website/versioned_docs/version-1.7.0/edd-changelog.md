#### Configuration
Once the plugin has been installed, you will find a new Metabox at the bottom of the page called “Changelog” that will allow to manage the versioning of your products. Also a new icon will appear inside WordPress editor called “Codegain shortcodes” in which you can automatically insert shortcodes necessary for the plugin operation.

You can choose between three different templates (one choose at the time):

- **Timeline**

- **Box**

- **Accordion**

#### Customization
You can customize the changelog  template, simply creating a folder in your active theme directory called cdg-edd-changelog in which you can overwrite the original templates:

- Content-Changelog_Accordion.php 
- Content-changelog_ Box.php
- Content-Changelog_Timeline.php 
Once you did overwrite these templates, the plugin will show your own templates, instead of the original ones.
