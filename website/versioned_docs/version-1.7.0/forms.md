## How to configure Form Blocks

Webflow does no longer export Forms functionality, if not hosted on its server, but you can decide to use WordPress to manage them.

Forms will be sent via email to the admin.

Insert a **Form Block** element and customize it as you prefer.

Select the Form Block from the Navigator and insert these attributes:

> wp=general
>
> el=form
