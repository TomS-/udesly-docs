> **Tips:**
> Take a look at our [elements pack](https://webflow.com/website/webflow-to-shopify-elements). Itâ€™s a set of all the most used elements with the necessary custom attributes already added. You just need to copy and paste the element in your Webflow page and give it your own style. This will help you quicken the workflow. If you have already completed your design and just want to convert the project to Shopify, maybe the quicker way to proceed is to add the custom attributes manually following our guide.
>
> Otherwise, you can start from scratch following the guide below.

## Facebook

Insert a link item and add the attribute:

> social=facebook

## Twitter

Insert a link item and add the attribute:

> social=twitter

## Linkedin

Insert a link item and add the attribute:

> social=linkedin

> **Take in Mind**
>
> In our documentation you will find custom attributes in 2 formats:
>
> **name=value** or **name={dynamic-value}**
>
>
> **Attribute**             | **Meaning** | 
> -------------             | --------------- |
> | item=title              | *item* is the *Name* and *title* is the *Value* |
> | dimension={dimension}   | *dimension* is the *Name* and instead of {dimension} you have to insert one of the accepted value that you'll find indicated each time. For example dimension can be *master*|
