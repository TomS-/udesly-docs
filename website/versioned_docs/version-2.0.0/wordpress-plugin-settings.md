In this section you can manage the various options related to your template converted from webflow, according to a scheme divided by sections:

## Blog

All settings related to your blog archive page are manageable here. You can handle the archive title, the archive description, categories and tags titles, all the info related to the author, besides the excerpt lenght and the types of categories you want to display.

## WooCommerce

The WooCommerce settings section is very helpful because it allows, first of all, to manage (enable/disable) the css of your WooCommerce pages: general css, layout css, smallscreens css that may enter in conflict with your Webflow style.

Then, you can decide the WooCommerce category hierarchy you want to display and the number of upsell/related products.
