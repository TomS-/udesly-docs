You can create pages in Webflow that will be used in WordPress to create new pages. 

To define a page as *Default page* add the following attribute on the Body element:

> page=default

To define a page as *Template page* add the following attribute on the Body element:

> page=template

**If you do not select any template from the template selector, it will act as a generic Default page.**

> **Tips:**
> Take a look at our [elements pack](https://webflow.com/website/webflow-to-shopify-elements). Itâ€™s a set of all the most used elements with the necessary custom attributes already added. You just need to copy and paste the element in your Webflow page and give it your own style. This will help you quicken the workflow. If you have already completed your design and just want to convert the project to Shopify, maybe the quicker way to proceed is to add the custom attributes manually following our guide.
