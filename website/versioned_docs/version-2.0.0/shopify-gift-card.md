A gift card is a special type of product. Its value can be used as payment toward future orders from your online store. Follow this guide to design this page in Webflow and convert it to Shopify.

The following elements can be added only in the page set as **Gift Card**.
Gift Card page must have the following attribute entered on the body:

> page=gift-card

<pre>
<video autoplay muted playsinline="true" loop>
<source src="/assets/page-type.webm">
</video>
</pre>

> **Tips:**
> Take a look at our [elements pack](https://preview.webflow.com/preview/webflow-to-shopify-elements?utm_medium=preview_link&utm_source=designer&utm_content=webflow-to-shopify-elements&preview=71280fc62c37d44b2222bbe7b9a3e953&mode=preview). Itâ€™s a set of all the most used elements with the necessary custom attributes already added. You just need to copy and paste the element in your Webflow page and give it your own style. This will help you quicken the workflow. If you have already completed your design and just want to convert the project to Shopify, maybe the quicker way to proceed is to add the custom attributes manually following our guide.
