> **Tips:**
> Take a look at our [elements pack](https://webflow.com/website/webflow-to-wordpress-elements-pack). Itâ€™s a set of all the most used elements with the necessary custom attributes already added. You just need to copy and paste the element in your Webflow page and give it your own style. This will help you quicken the workflow. If you have already completed your design and just want to convert the project to WordPress, maybe the quicker way to proceed is to add the custom attributes manually following our guide.
>
> Otherwise, if you want to start from scratch, follow the guide below.

Insert a **Text Block** with the following attribute:

> sidebar={your sidebar name}

You can choose the name you prefer the most, the Adapter will register it automatically.

> **Take in Mind**

> In our documentation you will find custom attributes in 2 formats:
>
> **name=value** or **name={dynamic-value}**
