Custom post types are content types like posts and pages. Since WordPress evolved from a simple blogging platform into a robust CMS, the term *post* stuck to it. However, a post type can be any kind of content.

The Udesly plugin controls if pages you've created as CPT already use a CPT defined by a third party plugin. If it's not already defined, the plugin gives you the possibility to create one. Just follow the path from WP admin panel: *Udesly > Custom Post Types* 

In WordPress that are several type of pages that can be used as an archive of custom post type. Don't forget to define your page accordingly to the list below by adding the correspondent attribute on the body of the page:

<pre>
<video autoplay muted playsinline="true" loop>
<source src="/assets/page-type.webm">
</video>
</pre>

## Archive Pages

- **Main Archive Page**

    This page is used for Main archive for CPT Page and for CPT taxonomies.

    > page=archive
    >
    > post-type={your post type}


## Taxonomy Pages

If a third party plugin has defined a taxonomy for a CPT, you can use that taxonomy. Otherwise, if you created the CPT in the Udesly plugin, you'll find there a field allowing to define taxonomies. The Udesly plugin will define these taxonomies in a specific format: {post-type}_{taxonomy}. 

E.g: if you created a post type called *event* and added taxonomies as category, the taxonomy will be **event_category**

- **Taxonomy page**

    This page is used for every tag of your WordPress. This page must have the following attributes on the Body:

    > page=taxonomy
    >
    > post-type={your taxonomy}



- **Specific Taxonomy page**

    This page is used for a specific taxonomy of your WordPress. This page must have the following attributes on the Body:

    > page=taxonomy
    >
    > post-type={your taxonomy}
    >
    > specific={slug of your tag or ID of your taxonomy}


*The following list includes all elements you can enter within these pages.*

> **Tips:**
> Take a look at our [elements pack](https://webflow.com/website/webflow-to-wordpress-elements-pack). Itâ€™s a set of all the most used elements with the necessary custom attributes already added. You just need to copy and paste the element in your Webflow page and give it your own style. This will help you quicken the workflow. If you have already completed your design and just want to convert the project to WordPress, maybe the quicker way to proceed is to add the custom attributes manually following our guide.
