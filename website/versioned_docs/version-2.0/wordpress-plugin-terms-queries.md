According to the same reasoning underlying the posts queries, the terms queries allow to retrieve terms from the database, using different parameters, so that they can be displayed on the frontend, if you are using **lists**.

---------
> **In WordPress, a term is a classification, group or subset of a Taxonomy, where the latter can be a Category, Tag or Custom Taxonomy. By default, terms have a title, a slug and a description.** 


Click on **Add new terms query** button, you'll find several fields helping you to define the term you want to display.

**N.B.** Remember to assign the same name as the one you have assigned in Webflow!

## Count
Here you can define the number of taxonomies to display. By default it is set on 3. 

Furthermore, the **Offset** option allows to skip a given number of terms types, if you need.
